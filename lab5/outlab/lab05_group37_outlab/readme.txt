Task B
----------------------------------------------------------------
Files changed - 

1. callbacks.cpp (edit explained in answers)

2. dominos.cpp (implemented functions declared in dominos.hpp)

3. dominos.hpp (defined structs Magnet,Slider,Ball; declared keyboard,step and mouse_down functions)

(These functions are declared in the parent class. Redeclaring in the dominos_t class overrides them to achieve desired function.)

Instructions to run :-

Replace the cs251_base_code/src/ directory in the inlab code (for Goldberg machine) with the given src directory, and follow similar instructions to compile.

Task A - 

Task B -
The code structure in the inlab was very complicated. We could not think of writing it from scratch. So we started from inlab and started by modifying dominos.cpp. We came to know about use of step function inherited from parent by reading code for testbeds. Testbeds were very useful. We read about detecting collisions from given manual and ibox2d.org. Also, we could easily assign 'q' and 't' keys to respective purposes. But assigning arrow keys was harder. We searched for the code that moves the window on pressing arrow keys and found it as well. Then some time was spent in figuring out how to call it in dominos.cpp. We made some finishing changes and we were done.
