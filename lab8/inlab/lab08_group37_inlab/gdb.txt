B.8
whatis minVal
whatis A.size()

B.9
A.size() is of size_type which stores an unsigned integer. When minVal(an int) is compared with A.size(), C++ intrinsically converts it to size_type which can only be positive. Thus minVal gets converted to a very large positive integer. Hence loop runs for a very long time.

(
We reached at this conclusion since in B.7 we got

(gdb) p (int)A.size() < minVal
$9 = false
(gdb) p A.size() < minVal
$10 = true
)
