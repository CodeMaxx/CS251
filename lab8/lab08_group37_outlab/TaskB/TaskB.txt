Task
------
After we tried to compile it normally, we got an error that processSituation function had too little parameters passed. And we could not check each and every file. So generating a documentation made our lives easier. 

We generated a normal Doxygen file and made the following changes (keeping it in the same directory as intelligentReverseSpin.cpp)-

INPUT = glm/ includes.h intelligentReverseSpin.cpp
RECURSIVE = YES

This created the complete docs. We went to the HTML version and searched for processSituation. We saw this in the docs for the function -

Process a given situation vector

Parameters
situation	The current situation
summary	should be set to sum of all four values in situation
a	set to any value
b	set to any value
c	value must be a+b
See also
GLM_GTX_vector_query extensions.

We passed 1,1,2 as a,b,c and for the summary, we had to lookup the `vec4` class and we saw that they used 4 variables - x,y,z,w.
In the summary, we simply passed the sum.
