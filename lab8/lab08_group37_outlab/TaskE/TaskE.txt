Task
------
I took a look at the given source and understood that the values of the 3 'check' variables needed to be changed.

So I used the following commands:-

1. start - To break at main
2. set preFlightCheck1 = true
3. set preFlightCheck2 = true
4. set finalFlightCheck = true

These set all three variables to true so none of the if condition is true and printKey() function gets executing on using `continue` command.
