So first we ran the executable and saw what all was happening.
Then seeing the suggested reading we decided to use `info functions`. we saw the functions in FinalBattle.cpp(since that was the file from which the binary was compiled). Seeing the function battle() we suspected that should be the place where the battle happened. So we put a breakpoint at battle(). Inside the function we used `info locals` to get the local variables and found a variable called `EnemyHP`. So we have to change this to 0 and then `continue` running and we would win. It wasn't showing the correct HP ( 10000 ) as of now so we used `next` 3 or 4 times and checked its value again. Now we had `EnemyHP = 10000`. So we used `set EnemyHP = 0` and then used `continue`. And got the result 'You Win'.
