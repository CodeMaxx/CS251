Reflection Essay:-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This lab was interesting. The theme reminded us of our favorite characters in chidhood. We want more such labs! The tools used in this lab will be very useful in general. We think gdb tasks should have been harder. They didn't involve much learning. We think that this lab should have been earlier, so that it would help in CS 293.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK A:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The task was easy. It was easy to figure out which part took the highest time, and then it was a piece of cake to change the function to run much faster. Once we used the DP solution, and found our first item, we were further motivated to do the other ones. Although the task wasn't as challenging, we enjoyed it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK B:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This task was also fun! We came to know what Doxygen is capable of (we know that we have just scratched the surface, the Doxygen documentation is huge).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK C:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gdb tasks were pretty easy in general. Just like in class demo, we were able to figure out the exact statement where SEGFAULT occured. So it was pretty cool.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK D:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matplotlib is a very easy to use and highly user-friendly. Since its written in python, it was a breeze to work on. Scatter plot was easy to make, and we didn't really expect a 'message' inside the scatter plot. Brilliant idea!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK E:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task E was really really simple. We didn't like it since not much learning happened here. This task however showed that how you can really modify anything in gdb and get any part of the code executed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK F:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier we thought that we would have to write the sorting algorithm, but built-in sort command saved the day! The rest was just a matter of syntax. It was good, as some of the bash syntax and commands got revised.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK G:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The given code was very very inefficient. So optimising it didn't took much time. We discovered gprof2dot and dot tools to view call graphs. They will be very useful in future.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK H:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was interesting and required looking and poking around. It didn't really require all the characters though(When you have gdb no input matters :P). Winning the final battle, we completed the outlab.
