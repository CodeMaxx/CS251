Feature used to create a function:

`alt + shift + M`

on the keyboard. Then gave the name of the function in the dialog box. Had to place the file in a project for this to work.

For renaming the class, feature of eclipse used:

`alt + shift + R`

The new method using thread is very superior to the original program. It runs about 3 times as fast as the original code.(Took ~7 seconds while the original toop ~21 seconds.). Also using `top` command we saw that while the original code used 100% of the cpu. the threaded code uses more than 300% and thus is almost 3 times as fast.
