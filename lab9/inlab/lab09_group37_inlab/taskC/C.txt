Setting the alias:
--------------------

The alias is set using

`alias omp4j='java8 -jar <path_to_jar_file>'`

which in my case was(using relative path)

alias omp4j='java8 -jar ./omp4j-1.2.jar'

Time = 6.805s
CPU usage = 381.1%

This runs a little faster than the threaded one since it is able to use multiple cores efficiently(CPU usage is more).

Harry should use multi-core since it the fastest mechanism to get the answer.
